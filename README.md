# HD2F
Hack Domain Driven Framework

Experimental Framework written in Hacklang and DDD (Domain Driven Design) approach.

I'm still studying DDD and Hack, so please help me and give me your contribute if I did something wrong.

As long there's no stable framework written full in hack and that there are a lot of other great php frameworks that works good on HHVM (like Laravel and Symfony), I do not want to rewrite a new one from the scratch and reinventing the wheel. 

This why this can be called a "meta framework", a generic and abstract framework written in hack that can be extended using a php full working framework. 

Every modern framework have a router, a dependency injection container, some "controller", a serializator. This is basically a standard flow for a rest api. 

This framework abstract this flow and allow then to write a full hack code without reimplements a new framework.
